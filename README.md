###### Aruku valley

 I like the location of Aruku valley and it was also know as ooty of Andhra Pradesh.<br>It has ***Pure coffee bean plants*** and also lot of greenary around that place.<br> Early morning snow was amazing.
 And the people in the ***Aruku Valley*** were very simple and hard workers. The locations was simply wonderful. A very good place to visit and explore the Nature.
