###### Aruku valley

 I like the location of Aruku valley and it was also know as ooty of Andhra Pradesh.<br>It has ***Pure coffee bean plants*** and alos lot of Greenary around the that place.<br> Early morning snow was amazing.
 And the people in the ***Aruku Valley*** were very simple and hard workers. And locations was simply wonderfull. A very good place to visit and explore.
